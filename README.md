## How to use the files?

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` for development mode. New browser window should open automatically.
4. Run `npm run prod` for production mode. The compiled files are saved to the `./dist` folder (which will be created if it doesn't already exist).
